            <h1>Updates regarding COVID-19:</h1>
            <br></br>
            <p>In light of the evolving global developments of the COVID-19 pandemic (coronavirus), we 
                are all challenged to change our habits to help contain the spread of the disease for our 
                personal protection, for the good of society and for the secure continuation of business.</p>
            <br></br>
            We assume this responsibility for the welfare our employees, their families, you – our 
                clients – and indirectly for many people around us and want to inform you today about the 
                measures we have taken. As a software provider and modern employer, we are privileged to 
                have most of the required infrastructure and processes already in place, so we were able to 
                adapt our operations quickly and without disruption:
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <li>Remote working options are available to all and, for the time being, compulsory for most PACE 
                employees. Your points of contact continue their work from home and are reachable as always 
                through e-mail and by phone.</li>
                <li>We want to avoid personal meetings, participation at conferences and trade shows (if not already
                 canceled) whenever possible and are focusing on remote collaboration. Working with geographically 
                 dispersed teams and customers is our daily business, so we can offer you tried and tested ways of 
                 communicating and managing projects online – feel free to discuss alternative approaches with us!</li>
                <li>Our offices remain open with a skeleton crew, but we strongly discourage visits to the building. 
                    We are implementing all recommendations and instructions from the health care institutions and politics.
                We believe that the key to overcome this difficult period is flexibility, commitment and transparency. 
                Despite the drastic changes in our lifestyle, PACE is and will remain fully operational and you can rely 
                on us to do everything necessary to continue and develop our business relationship in these challenging times.</li>
                <br></br>
                <p>Please don’t hesitate to contact us whenever you need support or if you have any questions.</p>
